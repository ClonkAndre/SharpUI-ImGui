# SharpUI-ImGui
SharpUI is a library that allows you to easily create your own Rockstar-like menus for Grand Theft Auto IV.  
Inspired by NativeUI for GTA V.  

This version is based of the first [SharpUI](https://github.com/ClonkAndre/SharpUI) version, unlike the first version tho, this version is powered by [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), for a more powerful, and reliable experience.

Works with [IV-SDK .NET](https://github.com/ClonkAndre/IV-SDK-DotNet) v1.5 and above.
